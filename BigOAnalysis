For our program there are three essential algorithms being implemented: bubblesort, mergesort and quicksort.

The bubblesort algorithm is implemented with a nested for loop which has a complexity of O(N^2). The function to format the bubblesort does not contain any loops and its instructions merely have a complexity of O(1).

The mergesort algorithm is implemented with

The quicksort algorithm is implemented with
